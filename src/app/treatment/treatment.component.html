                      <h1>TREATMENT FOR CORONAVIRUS</h1>
                      <p><span>To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat
                              COVID-2019.</span>
                          However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness
                          should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.</p>

                          symptoms while your body fights the illness. You'll need to stay in isolation, away from
                          other
                          people, until you have recovered.</p>
